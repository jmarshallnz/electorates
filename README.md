## NZ Electorate data ##

This contains a (really simple, hacked up quickly) R script to extract data
from a Stats NZ excel sheet into separate .csv tables.

The extracted data (in the .csv folder) have not been checked for whether they've
extracted correctly other than a cursory look through.

The levels in each of the tables aren't definable without knowing something about
the data themselves, thus I've labelled them level0 through levelk where level0
represents the 'innermost' level present in the data.

All total columns have been removed in these data.
